## How Does Box Mara Fix 1.8 Work?
 
Box Mara Fix 1.8 is a compressed file that contains an executable file and a script file. The executable file is named box.exe and the script file is named mara-fix.cmd. When you run box.exe, it will extract the script file to a temporary folder and execute it. The script file will then perform several actions, such as:
 
- Killing the ESET service and processes.
- Deleting the ESET registry entries and files.
- Copying the modified ESET files from the box.exe archive to the ESET installation folder.
- Creating a scheduled task to run box.exe every time the system starts.
- Restarting the ESET service and processes.

After these steps, Box Mara Fix 1.8 will display a message saying that ESET NOD32 Antivirus has been activated successfully. However, this activation is not genuine and may cause problems with your system security and performance.
