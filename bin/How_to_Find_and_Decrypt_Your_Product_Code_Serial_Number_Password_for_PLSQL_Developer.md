## How to Find Your Product Code Serial Number Password for PL/SQL Developer
 
The first step is to locate the file where PL/SQL Developer stores your connection details. This file is usually named `connections.ini` and it is located in the `%APPDATA%\PLSQL Developer\` folder. You can open this folder by typing `%APPDATA%\PLSQL Developer\` in the Windows Explorer address bar.
 
In the `connections.ini` file, you will see a list of sections with names like `[Connection 1]`, `[Connection 2]`, etc. Each section corresponds to a saved connection in PL/SQL Developer. You can identify the connection you are looking for by checking the values of the `DisplayName`, `Username`, and `Database` keys. For example, if you are looking for the connection named "Oracle Production" with the username "user" and the database "db\_host:1521/db\_name", you will look for a section like this:

    [Connection 7]
    DisplayName=Oracle Production
    IsFolder=0
    Number=7
    Parent=2
    Username=user
    Database=db_host:1521/db_name
    ConnectAs=Normal
    Edition=
    Workspace=
    AutoConnect=0
    ConnectionMatch=536870911
    Password=2578502833104824427441244294443234184532
    IdentifiedExt=0
    Color=65535

The value of the `Password` key is your encrypted product code serial number password for PL/SQL Developer. In this example, it is `2578502833104824427441244294443234184532`.
 
## How to Decrypt Your Product Code Serial Number Password for PL/SQL Developer
 
The next step is to decrypt your product code serial number password for PL/SQL Developer. There are different ways to do this, depending on your preference and skill level. Here are some options:
 
- **Use an online tool.** There are some websites that offer tools to decrypt PL/SQL Developer passwords. For example, you can use [http://show-me-password.tomecode.com/](http://show-me-password.tomecode.com/).[^2^] All you need to do is paste your encrypted password in the input box and click on "Show me password". The website will display your decrypted password in plain text. However, be careful when using online tools, as they may not be secure or reliable.
- **Use a C# program.** If you have some programming skills, you can write or use a C# program to decrypt PL/SQL Developer passwords. The algorithm used by PL/SQL Developer to encrypt passwords is very simple and has been reverse-engineered by some researchers.[^1^] You can find an example of a C# program that can decrypt PL/SQL Developer passwords here: https://adamcaudill.com/2016/02/02/plsql-developer-nonexistent-encryption/.[^1^] You can run this program on your own computer or use an online compiler like https://dotnetfiddle.net/. All you need to do is replace the value of the `scrambled` variable with your encrypted password and run the program. The program will print your decrypted password in plain text.
- **Use a manual method.** If you want to understand how PL/SQL Developer encrypts passwords and decrypt them yourself, you can follow these steps:
    1. Convert your encrypted password from decimal to hexadecimal. For example, if your encrypted 0f148eb4a0
